    <h1>Genetics</h1>
    <p>Humans have 46 paired chromosomes, with about 23,000 genes. The 46 chromosomes in the human cell are made up of 22 paired chromosomes. These are numbered from 1 to 22 according to size, with chromosome number 1 being the biggest. These numbered chromosomes are called autosomes. Cells in the body of a woman also contain two sex chromosomes called X chromosomes, in addition to the 44 autosomes. Body cells in men contain an X and a Y chromosome and 44 autosomes.
</p>
    <p>The 23,000 genes come in pairs. One gene in each pair is inherited from the person’s mother and the other from their father. A sperm and an egg each contain one copy of every gene needed to make up a person (one set of 23 chromosomes each). When the sperm fertilises the egg, two copies of each gene are present (46 chromosomes), and so a new life can begin.</p>
    <p>The chromosomes that decide the sex of the baby are called sex chromosomes. The mother’s egg always contributes an X, while the father’s sperm provides either an X or a Y. An XX pairing means a girl, while an XY pairing means a boy. As well as determining sex, these chromosomes carry genes that control other body functions. There are many genes located on the X chromosome, but only a few on the Y chromosome. </p>
